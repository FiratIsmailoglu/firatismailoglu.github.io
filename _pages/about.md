Hi, welcome to my website! I am Firat Ismailoglu, PhD. I have been working in data science for more than ten years and in the meantime I have gained experience in many aspects of it.

In addition to serving as my professional blog, this website will also be dedicated to providing educational resources, including lecture notes and source codes, in the fields of data science, computer science, and mathematics. Please feel free to utilize them and do not hesitate to [contact](mailto:firism@gmail.com) me if you encounter any issues.
