Hi, welcome to my website! I am Firat Ismailoglu, PhD. I have been working in data science for more than ten years and in the meantime I have gained experience in many aspects of it.

In addition to serving as my professional blog, this website will also be dedicated to providing educational resources, including lecture notes and source codes, in the fields of data science, computer science, and mathematics. Please feel free to utilize them and do not hesitate to [contact](mailto:firism@gmail.com) me if you encounter any issues.



Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
